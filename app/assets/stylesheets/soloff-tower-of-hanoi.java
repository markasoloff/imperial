/* Tower of Hanoi

 

Problem Description:

The candidate has to resolve "Tower of Hanoi" problem.

When a program runs, it should ask for  "Number of Towers" (at least 5 max 10) & "Number of Disks" (max 40)

The program should show each step in output. 

 
Requirements: 
1. Program asks user for "Number of Towers". They must select a number between 5 and 10 - error message for all other inputs.
2. Program asks user for "Number of Disks". They must select a number between 3 and 40 - error message for 0 - 2 disks or any unsantized input.

Evaluation Criteria:

OOPs concept (10%)
Coding standard (10%)
Problem-solving skill (80%)


The full requirements:

Must correctly solve the required motion without violating stacking rules (e.g. on each peg, no bigger disk sits on any smaller disk).

5 - 10 towers / pegs
3 - 40 disks
Not required but preferred:

Good software engineering practices (e.g. code formatting, variable names, comments / JavaDoc, unit tests)
Efficiency of moves (no unneeded moves)
Efficiency of code (time and space complexity)  At least be able to estimate general space/time complexity.



questions:
What is JavaDoc?
How do I apply unit tests to a java program?
How do I format Java?
How do I comment in Java?
How do I name variables in Java?
How do I determine the efficiency of my program/'s' moves?

What is the time and space complexity of my program? 
How do I estimate time and space complexity?
